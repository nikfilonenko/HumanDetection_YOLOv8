# About the project ***`HumanDetection_YOLOv8`***
## `(1)` A little bit about the dataset
- This dataset was created by extracting `frames` from `12 short videos`. To enrich this data collection with a variety of images, such as blurry images, small-sized images, and others, it was decided to use the unmarked data set available on Kaggle. 

- **After the required number of frames was obtained, all images were annotated using the [`Roboflow platform`](https://roboflow.com/).**
